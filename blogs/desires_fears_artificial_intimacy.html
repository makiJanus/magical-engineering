        <h2 class="subtitle">Can the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
          for Sexual Satisfaction Promote Immoral and Dehumanizing
          Behaviors?</h2>

        <p>With the emerging use of artificial intelligence and robotics for
          sexual satisfaction, new ethical and social concerns arise. These
          artificial companions could foster dehumanizing and unethical
          behaviors, and this blog will examine these issues from different
          perspectives.</p>

        <p>One of the main concerns is that an object in the shape of a woman
          could foster the perception of women as mere objects of sexual
          satisfaction. This could trigger unhealthy dynamics of violence and
          submission, similar to those associated with pornography.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the use of language models raises concerns about the type
          of emotional relationships that could arise when communicating with
          these artificial beings. If they can satisfy us comprehensively,
          adjusting to our needs and desires, what kind of world awaits us in
          the future?</p>

        <p>From the perspective of systems philosophy, humans can be understood
          as a set of interconnected characteristics that interact coherently
          with their environment. Simplifying:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Body:</strong> Perceives and processes the environment at
            a pre-linguistic level.</li>
          <li><strong>Mind:</strong> Gives meaning to experiences through
            language with judgments and knowledge.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This perspective allows us to see the interaction with artificial
          beings as a reflection of preconceived ideas about how sexual and
          emotional interactions should be. According to the theory of the
          equation of media, people tend to anthropomorphize machines, assigning
          them social roles based on stereotypes. Thus, the way we interact with
          artificial companions, whether kindly or cruelly, morally or
          immorally, depends largely on our own behaviors and desires towards
          other humans.</p>

        <img class="gif" src="/src/blog_posts/blog3/img2.png"
          alt="Isaac Sim Deep Learning simmulation with Kaya">

        <p>The main issue is that artificial companions can now have an
          appearance very similar to humans. We attribute humanity to what
          appears to be human. For example, nobody worries about a robotic arm
          in a factory or a robot serving food at a table, as they do not evoke
          concerns about human rights. However, if these robots had a human
          appearance, especially with specific racial characteristics, ethical
          concerns would arise. Simple sex toys, like dildos, have been marketed
          without major issues, but expanding them to a full body raises
          concerns about how humans treat each other, reflected in these
          machines. It seems to be then an issue of aesthetics and design.p>

          <p>To prevent immoral and unhealthy uses that may transfer to human
            relationships, artificial beings can be designed with mechanisms to
            prevent objectifying or violent behaviors. For example:p>

            <ol>
              <li>Emitting annoying sounds in response to inappropriate
                behaviors.</li>
              <li>Ceasing to function upon detecting inappropriate
                behavior.</li>
              <li>Changing to a color reflecting illness, such as a shade of
                green, in response to immoral acts.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The aim is for these mechanisms to break the
              "willing suspension of disbelief," which is the willingness to
              accept the illusion of interacting with a real being. This way,
              human-machine interaction can be regulated, addressing the
              mentioned concerns and creating companions that satisfy us
              physically and emotionally. Additionally, they can encourage us to
              become more balanced humans, allowing us to explore a wide range
              of interactions in a risk-free environment without judgments based
              on changing cultural norms.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>It is inevitable that we perceive interactions with artificial
              companions as interactions with other humans, depending on their
              level of anthropomorphism. The misuse of these companions depends
              on how we desire to interact with them and whether it is possible
              given their design, reflecting in one way or another how we wish
              to relate to other humans.</p>

            <p>Thus, we can posit that robots and virtual humanoids are not
              inherently problematic. Through their design, it is possible to
              regulate human-machine interactions, addressing the aforementioned
              concerns and creating companions that satisfy us physically and
              emotionally without resorting to violent, immoral, or unhealthy
              practices that may transfer to human relationships, while
              simultaneously providing a safe environment for free
              exploration.</p>
