        <h2 class="subtitle">As the lines between fantasy and reality continue
          to blur, a new generation of artificial sexual companions is emerging.
          But what does this mean for our relationships, our desires, and our
          very understanding of what it means to be human?</h2>

        <p>Sexual interactions with artificial beings have been a topic of
          controversy for some time now, but what lies beneath the surface?
          <a
            href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19734-6_1"
            target="_blank">Researchers propose</a>
          that people tend to respond to sexualized robots
          in almost the same way as they would respond to other humans. To
          better understand this phenomenon, we must delve into the world of
          psychology and technology.</p>

        <p>One theory that attempts to capture all relevant factors that
          contribute or reduce the illusion of real sexual interactions with
          technology-based partners is the "sexual interaction illusion."
          According to this theory, users might automatically respond to
          artificial sexual interactions as they would respond to real-life
          counterparts despite consciously knowing they are only interacting
          with technology. This phenomenon can be explained by the media
          equation theory, which proposes that humans tend to treat machines
          like computers and robots as if they were real people.</p>

        <img class="gif" src="/src/blog_posts/blog2/cyberlover1.png"
          alt="Isaac Sim Deep Learning simmulation with Kaya">

        <p>This tendency can lead to a blurring of the lines between reality and
          fantasy, which is particularly relevant in the context of sexual
          interactions with artificial partners. The willing suspension of
          disbelief allows us to become fully immersed in a fictional world or
          scenario, and in this case, it can lead to a powerful emotional
          experience that feels very real to the user.</p>

        <p>However, there are also potential risks associated with using
          artificial partners for sexual purposes. These include the possibility
          of exploitation or abuse, as well as the risk of becoming emotionally
          dependent on the technology. The concept of "goodness-of-fit" is
          crucial here, where the stereotypes given to the machine by the user's
          expectations must be in concordance with their own sexual script. If
          the user feels they can deviate from these norms, they may struggle to
          create and maintain the willing suspension of belief.</p>

        <p>The necessary cues for that can be represented as verbal and
          nonverbal signs where the response is likely to follow if the decisive
          cues are presented. However, to what extent? If we consider the world
          of pornographic mangas and hentai, it's possible to say that these
          cues may not need to be realistic, being possible to use more abstract
          cues.</p>

          alt="Isaac Sim Deep Learning simmulation with Kaya">

        <p>The "sexual interaction illusion model" starts out with the
          assumption that users' perception of sexual explicitness triggers
          sexual arousal. This idea can lead us to conclude that artificial
          partners can achieve an easier or better goodness-of-fit if they are
          able to adjust their interactions (verbal and nonverbal) to match the
          user's sexual preferences.</p>

        <p>Despite all the possible benefits, there are always risks or issues
          with this kind of use of technology. If we consider that humans see
          and interact with the world through our own and personal understanding
          of it, we will engage in ways that represent our strengths and
          weaknesses. So, it is understandable that there would be concern about
          the use of artificial beings to fulfill immoral and dangerous sexual
          practices.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>However, this starts with the user themselves. We assign social
          categories and personal stereotypes to machines and act accordingly.
          The root of the issue is always human. On the other hand, these
          interactions can also liberate us from social norms and judgment.
          These blog posts center on sexual interactions but the same mechanisms
          apply to other kinds of needs. If the machines are designed properly,
          they can foster human development that helps us explore our desires,
          what we would like to be or achieve, a romantic artificial partner can
          isolate us and make us emotionally dependent on it for profit's sake,
          or it can teach us in endless scenarios how to have healthy and happy
          relations and motivate us to become better versions of ourselves. Only
          time will tell which direction humanity will take.</p>

        <p><b><i>"Almost everyone wants somebody to love, but many people have
              no one.
              If this natural desire can be satisfied for everyone who is
              capable of
              loving, surely the world would be a much happier place. Many who
              would
              otherwise have become social misfits, social outcasts, or even
              worse
              will instead be better-balanced human beings."</i></b></p>
