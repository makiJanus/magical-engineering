          More and more children today are being diagnosed with neurodivergent conditions like autism.
          This project explores how technology can support these children in developing better social interaction skills.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Sandra Cano, a software engineer from PUCV, needed a friendly humanoid robot to interact with children on the autism spectrum.
          The robot had to express basic emotions through facial expressions and gestures using its arms, neck, and torso.
          For this request, only the mechanical model and electronic design were required.
        </p>
        <p>
          To meet this need, we designed a compact robot about 55 cm tall, with expressive capabilities focused on the face.
          To ensure it's appealing to kids, we adopted a cartoon-inspired aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping costs low was a top priority. The robot is 3D printed, and powered by a transformer instead of batteries.
          The requested sensor suite includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>ASTRA PRO REALSENSE RGBD</li>
          <li>10 DOF IMU (MPU9259+BMP280)</li>
          <li>RGB LEDs</li>
          <li>Nose-mounted potentiometer</li>
          <li>Speakers</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Eyes</h3>
        <p>
          The head's primary function is to convey emotions using eyes, mouth, and eyebrows.
          The nose includes a potentiometer as a tactile input.
          Eye movement is achieved using two SG90 servo motors.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/2.png" alt="Robot eyes movement">
        <p>
          Vertical eye movement is done through a bar mechanism with two fixed and two moving pivots.
          Since both the servo and the eye linkage are on the same side, the servo angle directly matches the eye angle — ideally within a 25° range.
          For horizontal motion, the servo moves the eye directly with a 30° range.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/3.png" alt="Robot eyes movement">

        <h3>Mouth</h3>
        <p>
          The mouth is controlled by two motors that shape a surgical tube into different expressions — happy, neutral, or sad/angry.
          Though the motors can rotate 180°, 45° is recommended for expressive but controlled movement.
          Developers are encouraged to experiment with other combinations.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/4.png" alt="Robot mouth movement">

        <h3>Eyebrows</h3>
        <p>
          Flexible expressions are achieved by manipulating a surgical tube with two degrees of freedom.
          The up/down motion has a 20° range, while the twisting motion spans 45°.
          These ranges are ideal; be cautious when combining them at extreme positions.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/5.png" alt="Robot eyebrows movements">

        <h3>Eyelids</h3>
        <p>
          Eyelids use a similar bar mechanism as the eyes.
          Here, the motor linkage is longer, resulting in a larger movement range — up to 95°.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/6.png" alt="Robot eyelids movements">

        <h3>Nose</h3>
        <p>
          The nose is the simplest moving component.
          Its potentiometer has a full 270° range, but only 135° (side-to-side) is used for interaction.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/7.png" alt="Robot nose movements">

        <h3>Neck</h3>
        <p>
          The robot's head weighs about 600g, with its center of mass 15 cm from the rotation axis.
          This requires ~9 kg·cm torque to move.
          A servo rated at 18.5 kg·cm@4.5V handles this with ease.
          The neck can tilt 20° forward and 25° backward.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/8.png" alt="Robot neck movements">

        <h3>Ears</h3>
        <p>
          Ears enhance emotional expression.
          They have two degrees of freedom: one allows up/down movement (120° range), the other rotates them up to 90°.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/9.png" alt="Robot Ears movements">

        <h3>Base and Torso</h3>
        <p>
          The base rotates within a 180° range via a single servo.
          A bearing ensures smooth motion.
          The torso requires more torque, so we implemented two redundant degrees of freedom.
          Assuming a 20° tilt instead of 90°, the torque requirement drops from 40 to about 15.4 kg·cm:
        </p>
        <p>
          $$45\cdot \cos(90° - 20°) = 15.39\ kg\cdot cm$$
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/10.png" alt="Robot base movements">

        <h3>Arms</h3>
        <p>
          Each arm has three servo-driven degrees of freedom, allowing a wide range of expressive motions.
        </p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project9/11.png" alt="Robot arms movements">

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          After successfully designing and simulating the robot, the parts were 3D printed and assembled.
          Below are some photos and a video showcasing the robot's expressive face — a key factor in social interaction.
