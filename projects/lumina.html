        <h1 class="massiveHeading">Lumina — A personality framework disguised as an erotic streamer</h1>

        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Lumina is an erotic virtual streamer that combines different AI technologies to create an 
          interactive and engaging experience for her audience.

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          Lumina has been one of the 
          most complex projects so far in terms of the number of elements that must work together for it to 
          function correctly. The end goal is a fully autonomous virtual streamer capable of interacting with 
          the audience without human intervention.
        </p>

          alt="Lumina streamer virtual erótica looking at a mirror">

        <p>
          The idea was never fully planned; it emerged as an accumulation of concepts that came together to 
          form Lumi, from early attempts to build an NLCA (Natural Language Cognitive Architecture) based on 
          large language models to experiments with text-to-image generative models, attempts to create a humanoid social robot, and an interest in the adult entertainment industry, all of which converged to give rise to this project.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s something that took a lot of time and resources, so monetization became a natural question. 
          Looking at the success of Projekt Melody, an erotic VTuber controlled by a real person, the most 
          accessible monetization path seemed to be Chaturbate, an adult streaming platform.
        </p>

        <h3>First attempt</h3>
        <p>
          Months were spent creating the first functional version of Lumina. 
          After running trial streams on Chaturbate, it became clear the idea was worth pursuing; users, few at 
          the time, seemed to enjoy the experience, and some left tips, feedback, and positive comments.
        </p>

        <h3>Total redesign</h3>
        <p>
          While implementing improvements, the first design mistake became obvious: spaghetti code inside a 
          monolithic software structure. Initially, this led me to organize and modularize the code, but as 
          complexity grew, a total redesign was necesary in favor of a microservices architecture. Each system 
          component gained standardized inputs and outputs, accelerating continuous improvement and easing 
          the integration of new technologies.
        </p>

          alt="Lumina's second architecture diagram">
        
        <p>
          This reduced inference time, from when information arrives from Chaturbate to when Lumina responds, from 
          ~30 seconds down to ~1.5 seconds, significantly improving the user experience. The best part is that 
          this same architecture can be repurposed for social robotics projects.
        </p>

        <h3>3D Model</h3>
        <p>
          Lumi is designed to look appealing, but achieving a good result requires several sequential stages. 
          The base model is created in tools like Daz3D or Blender, with special care given to skin textures 
          and details such as blush, freckles, and imperfections. Clothing and accessories are also designed, 
          from lingerie sets to more casual outfits.
        </p>

        <img class="gif" src="/src/project_posts/project11/7.png"
          alt="Lumina streamer virtual erótica 3D model clothed">
        
        <p>
          With the body completed, outfits and animations can be selected and exported into tools like Unreal 
          Engine, where a whole second configuration stage is required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Attention to detail is always important, lighting, shadows, and believable clothing are essential, but 
          beyond that, it’s necessary to add the subtle elements that make the model feel alive: hair dynamics, 
          breathing, blinking, and small facial motions, from scrunching the nose to micro saccades.
        </p>

        <h3>Beyond the 3D model — Generative AI</h3>
        <p>
          The erotic component was initially implemented as animations imported directly into Unreal Engine. 
          For each interaction category like kissing, oral sex, penetration, etc, a specific animation was required. 
          Each animation had to be created in an external program and then reconfigured in Unreal, which was a 
          slow and tedious process.
        </p>

        <p>
          While that pipeline still works and remains useful in specific cases, purely erotic animations were 
          first replaced by fully rendered sequences of those animations, improving visual quality while 
          preserving the general aesthetic of the 3D model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the limited versatility of the previous process, the next step was to incorporate state-of-the-art 
          generative models text-to-image, image-editing, and image-to-video, in any order as needed. This 
          enabled the creation of personalized erotic content for users, from images to videos, based on their 
          specific requests, increasing audience interaction and satisfaction.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond appearances, what has gradually taken shape is the first version of a framework that makes 
          sense of social interactions in a virtual environment, something applicable to robots. It builds an 
          understanding of its environment from incoming information, whether from humans, other systems, or 
          Lumina’s internal states, and from that, makes coherent, contextual decisions autonomously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social interaction between humans and artificial entities may feel strange to those of us who are older, 
          but amid increasing social fragmentation and loneliness, these systems are becoming more common.
