        <h3>The Circuit and How It Works</h3>
        <p>For this design I wanted to address these requirements:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Charge a 3.7 V Li-Ion/Li-Po Battery at maximum 4.2 V through
            USB.</li>
          <li>Be able to use a device with the circuit while it's recharging the
            battery.</li>
          <li>The circuit must have an output of 3.3 V.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is the final scheme of the circuit:</p>

        <img src="/src/project_posts/project4/circuit_eagle.png"
          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>The heart of the design is the MCP73838, this IC is a battery charge
          management controller, it requires a few elements to work, the typical
          application (available in the datasheet) circuit is:</p>

          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>As my intention is charge through USB I just ignored all the AC
          configuration like the double diode with common cathode and the Vc
          connection, pin 3 and 4 indicates the actual state of the charging
          process and faults:</p>

        <p>As you can see, the information provided by the LEDs can be
          misunderstood, like standby and temperature fault, but it's easy to
          see what state it really is because standby occurs when you haven't
          connected the battery. In my design, the STAT2 pin is connected to a
          green LED, and the STAT1 LED is connected to a blue LED (why not red?
          I don't remember, I'm still wondering).</p>

        <p>The TE pin is set to low to activate the built-in safety timer of
          four, six, or eight hours (depending on the model) that puts the
          charge IC in standby. The ROG2 pin is also set to low because the AC
          functionalities are not used. PROG1 is connected to a resistance to
          set the current that is supplied to the battery. In this case, a value
          of 2K ohms was selected to provide 500 mA (recommended 0.5C of the
          battery). The equation used is equation 4.1 available in the
          datasheet:</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i> I<sub>REG</sub> =
              1000V/R<sub>PROG</sub> </i></b></p>

        <p>The other part of the circuit is intended to be a load-sharing system
          (more detailed information is available in the application note; some
          pictures presented are from it). The VBUS (voltage supply from the
          USB) must supply the load when it's present. If not, the battery
          energizes the load:</p>

        <img src="/src/project_posts/project4/application_note_1.png"
          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>It is important to follow the schematic in the image above because if
          you connect the load directly to the battery, a very important issue
          appears. The battery charger can become confused and keep recharging
          the battery even if it is already fully charged. This is dangerous.
          This phenomenon happens because the MCP73838 automatically ends the
          charging process at a specific current value.</p>

          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>So a PMOS circuit based is designed to avoid any current issues:</p>
        <img src="/src/project_posts/project4/circuit_eagle_2.png"
          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>The PMOS gate is set to 0V through a pull-down resistor (R5). This
          ensures that the MOS turns on when VBUS is absent. In this situation,
          the battery energizes the load. Due to the fact that the transistor is
          not ideal, it has a maximum dropout voltage of 1.1V (typically 750mV).
          This is one of my major issues because in the worst-case scenario, the
          maximum voltage supply for the 3.3V regulator is 3.6V (and typically
          3.95V), but in practice, I have never noticed it. In the example log,
          the device works just well for a week or more until it gets
          discharged. Continuing with the circuit, if the VBUS is at 5V (maximum
          6V due to the IC battery management system specifications), the PMOS
          gets turned off, and the load is energized by the USB supply. The
          diode has a forward voltage of a maximum of 520mV, so the voltage on
          the IN pin of the 3.3V regulator is 4.48V. It really doesn't matter
          because it is a constant voltage. Another factor that this diode is
          useful for is to avoid a current flow from the source to the gate or
          from VBATT to VBUS. Nevertheless, there is still a leakage of 50uA
          (worst-case scenario), which generates a voltage across R5 of 500mV.
          It's a safe value because it doesn't turn off the MOS. Finally, the
          3.3V regulator has a maximum dropout voltage of 400mV, so the input
          must be above 3.7V (typically, it is 250mV, which implies a Vin of
          3.55V). The biggest allowed current is 600mA, so keep that in mind if
          you want to use it.</p>

        <h3>Use Example: Inexpensive 2.4MHz Mouse Converted to Rechargeable</h3>
        <p>As an example, a cheap wireless mouse is used. The idea is to replace
          the AAA batteries with a rechargeable one. I didn't find the datasheet
          of the IC in the mouse, but since it uses 3V, I assumed a Vin of 3.3V
          would be just fine. So, I simply tore apart the battery holder and
          placed the circuit with the new battery in that space.</p>

        <img src="/src/project_posts/project4/mouse_2.JPG"

        <img src="/src/project_posts/project4/mouse_4.JPG"
          alt="Isaac Sim robots and environments">

        <p>The mouse consumes 25 mA at 3.0V, and the battery can provide 250
          mAh. Ideally, with this setup, the mouse can be used for approximately
          10 hours on a single charge. To enhance the design, the mouse case can
          be modified for easier access to the USB charger port. For this
          modification, a 3D-printed case would be recommended. Creating a
          custom-designed case would allow for a seamless integration of the
          charging port while maintaining the mouse's ergonomics and
          aesthetics.</p>

        <p>While the initial conversion demonstrates the feasibility of
          converting a disposable battery device into a rechargeable one,
          further refinements through case modifications can significantly
          improve the user experience and overall functionality of the
          rechargeable wireless mouse. However, for the purposes of this
          example, the demonstration concludes with the successful integration
          of the rechargeable battery and charging circuit into the existing
          mouse case.</p>
