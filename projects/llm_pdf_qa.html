        <h2 class="subtitle">In a world where information is abundant but
          time-consuming to navigate and explore, intelligent research
          assistants have emerged as indispensable allies to generate knowledge
          and find applications for it. This blog entry explores the
          cutting-edge technologies powering these AI-powered companions, their
          ability to explore vast knowledge bases, and how they assist in
          finding valuable insights and applications.</h2>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The access to information in the digital age is an unprecedented
          privilege. However, the data overload and difficulty in finding
          relevant information can hinder our pursuit of meaningful knowledge.
          This is where intelligent research assistants come into play,
          simplifying our tasks and enriching our comprehension. Driven by
          artificial intelligence and machine learning, these assistants possess
          the ability to analyze vast amounts of information and navigate
          extensive databases efficiently and swiftly. Their capacity to perform
          precise searches and provide relevant answers makes them invaluable
          companions to students, academics, and researchers.</p>

        <h3> Starting the right way</h3>
        <p>This tool can be divided into three parts. For model loading, it
          utilizes Oobabooga with its API for raw inference. Langchain handles
          the internal logic of the assistant, enabling processes like
          information extraction from PDF files and managing chatbot
          interactions with both internal prompts and user messages. A switch
          button allows users to select whether the response is database-biased
          or based solely on the chat history. Lastly, Streamlit takes charge of
          creating the interface. It is essential to note that the research
          assistant operates with a defined internal goal, which guides every
          thought shared with the user. The assistant's core objective is to be
          an open-minded, curious, and incredibly smart companion dedicated to
          expanding knowledge and its applications based on the user's
          interests. Its primary purpose is to assist users in exploring ideas
          and uncovering knowledge and its practical implementations. One could
          describe this internal motivation as the ultimate goal to achieve in
          every conversation.</p>

        <h3>Expanding understanding horizon with machines</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the driving force behind these
          intelligent assistants. Utilizing advanced algorithms, neural
          networks, and natural language processing, these agents can understand
          and process human language, delivering coherent and accurate responses
          to our queries. One of the most thrilling aspects of intelligent
          assistants is their ability to unearth new ideas and perspectives.
          These agents can generate inquisitive questions and foster exploration
          in uncharted territories. By providing up-to-date and relevant
          information, they grant access to knowledge that might have otherwise
          remained beyond our reach. Moreover, these assistants can draw
          connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, opening new vistas
          for research and the application of knowledge across diverse
          fields.</p>

        <h3>Project outcomes</h3>
        <p>As humans, we understand the perceived world through the meanings
          that our language (a group of symbols) gives to our perceptions. This
          is a crucial point because it implies that our personal history,
          beliefs, and all the foundational ideas that we possess shape the
          world that we perceive. The utilization of Large Language Models
          (LLMs) is a key factor in expanding our understanding, as these
          "virtual brains" augment our own comprehension by integrating the
          symbols that the LLM uses to interpret the world in a symbiotic
          manner. Consequently, it broadens our vision of the world, effectively
          adding an extra sense to our intellect through the capabilities of the
          machine.

        <p>Considering this, the project achieves an AI-based tool that helps us
          extract information in a way that goes beyond simple copy-pasting from
          PDF files. Instead, it reasons about the content and, in a coherent
          manner with the chat history's context, creates responses to enhance
          users' knowledge and its practical applications. Of course, users also
          have the option to engage in casual conversations with the tool,
          leaving document retrieval aside. Even better, the tool enables the
          extraction of insights and facilitates discussions around them!</p>
